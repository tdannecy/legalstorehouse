Because mid-level clinicians often work in rural or remote areas where physicians are scarce or where there are few surgical facilities or equipment, the expansion of the medical abortion provider pool has the potential to greatly improve the reproductive health of women worldwide.",

    "Meta description": "The eradication of the practice of torture in the world was one of the major challenges taken up by the United Nations only a few years after its establishment. In order to ensure adequate protection for all persons against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, over the years the United Nations has adopted universally applicable standards. These standards were ultimately embodied in international declarations and conventions. The adoption on 10 December 1984 by the General Assembly of the United Nations of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment rounded off the codification process to combat the practice of torture. In developing this valuable instrument, the United Nations did not merely put in writing in a series of articles a body of principles and pious hopes, the implementation and observance of which would not be guaranteed by anything or anyone. It set up also a monitoring body, the Committee against Torture, whose main function is to ensure that the Convention is observed and implemented. The Committee met for the first time in April 1988 in Geneva and has since carried out intensive activities which, although often discreet, should make it known to the public at large.",

    "Note 1": "While this document does not usually present concluding observations, recent concluding observations by the Committee Against Torture, which monitors state compliance with the UN Convention Against Torture are groundbreaking. They affirm that denying abortion impacts women’s physical and mental health and can rise to a violation of the right to be free from torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. (see Ipas publications below on Treaty Monitoring Committee Concluding Observations) In 2006, CAT Committee recognized that Peru’s restrictive abortion law, which only allows abortion in cases where pregnancy poses a risk to a woman’s health or life, leads to “grave consequences, including the unnecessary deaths of women.” The Committee also called upon the Peru to “take whatever legal and other measures are necessary to effectively prevent acts that put women’s health at grave risk, by providing the required medical treatment….” The Committee made similar findings in its 2012 adding that that interpretation of guidelines on when abortion was legal for purposes of medical necessity were “too restrictive and lack clarity, leading women to seek unsafe illegal abortions.” It its 2011 review of Paraguay, the Committee against Torture also expressed concern about the long standing psychological consequences of banning abortion in cases of sexual violence, incest, or when the fetus is not viable. The Committee made similar findings in its review of Nicaragua in 2009, stating that laws that deny access to abortion in cases of sexual violence leads to “constant exposure to the violation … and causes serious traumatic stress and a risk of long-lasting psychological problems such as anxiety and depression,” recommending that the country liberalize its laws to allow for abortion in cases of sexual violence as a means of relieving such trauma.",

The Special Rapporteur raises concern over criminal law provisions discriminatory to women and by discriminatory application of criminal law. SR characterizes the criminalization of abortion as a discriminatory law, including in cases of miscarriages or threat to the life and health of the pregnant woman. He notes that by upholding discriminatory laws, judges and prosecutors become parties to the violation of the State’s international obligations. (Paragraph 74).",

For the purposes of the present general recommendation, therefore, \"women\" includes girls and adolescents. The general recommendation will set out the Committee's analysis of the key elements of article 12. (paragraph 8).\nPARENTAL CONSENT; The obligation to respect rights requires States parties to refrain from obstructing action taken by women in pursuit of their health goals. States parties should report on how public and private health- care providers meet their duties to respect women's rights to have access to health care. For example, States parties should not restrict women's access to health services or to the clinics that provide those services on the ground that women do not have the authorization of husbands, partners, parents or health authorities, because they are unmarried or because they are women. Other barriers to women's access to appropriate health care include laws that criminalize medical procedures only needed by women punish women who undergo those procedures. (paragraph 14). Note to reader: Please see other references to CEDAW General Recommendation 24 in other sections of the Legal Storehouse.",

Barriers include, but are not limited to authorization requirements, distance from health facilities, costs, etc. States have a duty to ensure women's right to safe motherhood and emergency obstetric services and they should allocate to these services the maximum extent of available resources. The Committee states that the principle of equity demands that poorer households should not be disproportionately burdened with health expenses as compared to richer households. Additionally, the Committee recommends that States should ensure that the training curricula of health workers include comprehensive, mandatory, gender-sensitive courses.",

Women will be less willing, for that reason, to seek medical care for diseases of the genital tract, for contraception or for incomplete abortion and in cases where they have suffered sexual or physical violence.\n22. States parties should also report on measures taken to ensure access to quality health care services, for example, by making them acceptable to women. Acceptable services are those which are delivered in a way that ensures that a woman gives her fully informed consent, respects her dignity, guarantees her confidentiality and is sensitive to her needs and perspectives.'\nRecommends requiring '…all health services to be consistent with the human rights of women, including the rights to autonomy, privacy, confidentiality, informed consent and choice'.",

While it is critically important to increase access to comprehensive sexuality education and contraception, these frames may be used to support those who seek to impose increased restrictions on abortion access.

This article discusses the process of expanding the interpretation of this “health exception” to mean that even the possibility of harm to health should make an abortion legal – which then becomes a mechanism for expanding women’s right of access to safe abortion services. The article reports on an assessment of the impact of disseminating information on this interpretation of risk to health in Latin America, and how a regional process of debate and training of health service providers in 2009–10 has influenced the views and practice of health professionals in Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. The training included human rights arguments for applying the health exception in a comprehensive manner. All the respondents recognized the importance of interpreting risk to health as far more than the risk of death. Data from two clinics in Colombia also show an important increase in the number of women who had a legal abortion following this training. Dissemination of information and training on the health exception must continue – to protect women’s right to health, reduce mortality and morbidity among those with unwanted pregnancies and encourage timely access to safe abortion services. © 2012 Reproductive Health Matters",

Under current Convention case-law, Member States have a positive obligation to ensure measures are in place to guarantee women's access to abortion where legal. The European Court of Human Rights has applied its long-standing standard that the 'Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory, but rights that are practical and effective' to the context of implementation of abortion regulation. It has addressed this in numerous cases and contexts, noting that the right to private life requires states to: legislate on abortion when the national constitution guarantees right to life of pregnant woman; to ensure procedural safeguards to access abortion; to be provided information on the health status of their pregnancies, including prenatal tests; to ensure information on patients undergoing an abortion is kept confidential; to regulate the practice of conscientious objection; and that a pregnant woman's right to private life supersedes that of the 'father's' when it comes to decisions to undergo an abortion.\n\nConvention bodies have carefully avoided stating the extent to which the European Convention on Human Rights requires states to ensure that abortion be legally available under domestic law.

This has motivated the Committee to adopt this general comment in order to raise awareness and provide States parties with guidance and support in their efforts to guarantee the respect for, protection and fulfilment of the rights of adolescents, including through the formulation of specific strategies and policies. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY: States are encouraged to ‘strictly’ respect adolescents’ right to privacy and confidentiality, including advice and counseling on health matters. Information may only be disclosed with consent of the adolescent or in or in the same situations applying to the violation of an adult’s confidentiality. ‘Adolescents deemed mature enough to receive counselling without the presence of a parent or other person are entitled to privacy and may request confidential services, including treatment. ‘ ( Paragraph 11) PARTICIPATION; DEVELOPMENT OF YOUTH FRIENDLY SERVICES; CONFIDENTIALITY; PRIVACY: ‘States parties should provide a safe and supportive environment for adolescents that ensures the opportunity to participate in decisions affecting their health, to build life skills, to acquire appropriate information, to receive counseling and to negotiate the health-behaviour choices they make. The realization of the right to health of adolescents is dependent on the development of youth-sensitive health care, which respects confidentiality and privacy and includes appropriate sexual and reproductive health services.’ (Paragraph 40) EVOLVING CAPACITY/MATURITY: This standard relates to the adolescent’s acquisition of sufficient maturity and understanding to make informed decisions on matters of importance, including on sexual and reproductive health services. (paragraph 9). Beforeparents give their consent, adolescents need to have a chance to express their views freely and their views should be given due weight... However, if the adolescent is of sufficient maturity, informed consent shall be obtained from the adolescent her/himself, while informing the parents if that is in the “best interest of the child” (art. 3) (Paragraph32) CONFIDENTIALITY; INFORMATION: States parties should (a) enact laws or regulations to ensure that confidential advice concerning treatment is provided to adolescents so that they can give their informed consent. Such laws or regulations should stipulate an age for this process, or refer to the evolving capacity of the child; and (b) provide training for health personnel on the rights of adolescents to privacy and confidentiality, to be informed about planned treatment and to give their informed consent to treatment. (Paragraph33) INFORMATION; PARENTAL CONSENT: States parties should provide adolescents with access to sexual and reproductive information, including on family planning and contraceptives, the dangers of early pregnancy, the prevention of HIV/AIDS and the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In addition, States parties should ensure that they have access to appropriate information, regardless of their marital status and whether their parents or guardians consent. It is essential to find proper means and methods of providing information that is adequate and sensitive to the particularities and specific rights of adolescent girls and boys. To this end, States parties are encouraged to ensure that adolescents are actively involved in the design and dissemination of information through a variety of channels beyond the school, including youth organizations, religious, community and other groups and the media. (Paragraph28) INFORMATION; REDUCING MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY; RIGHT TO SAFE ABORTION SERVICES: Adolescent girls should have access to information on the harm that early marriage and early pregnancy can cause, and those who become pregnant should have access to health services that are sensitive to their rights and particular needs. States parties should take measures to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in adolescent girls, particularly caused by early pregnancy and unsafe abortion practices, and to support adolescent parents. Young mothers, especially where support is lacking, may be prone to depression and anxiety, compromising their ability to care for their child. The Committee urges States parties (a) to develop and implement programmes that provide access to sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, contraception and safe abortion services where abortion is not against the law, adequate and comprehensive obstetric care and counselling;… (Paragraph 31). UNSAFE ABORTION; VIOLENCE: Adolescents who are sexually exploited, including in prostitution and pornography, are exposed to significant health risks, including STDs, HIV/AIDS, unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, violence and psychological distress. They have the right to physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration in an environment that fosters health, self‑respect and dignity (art. 39). It is the obligation of States parties to enact and enforce laws to prohibit all forms of sexual exploitation and related trafficking; to collaborate with other States parties to eliminate intercountry trafficking; and to provide appropriate health and counselling services to adolescents who have been sexually exploited, making sure that they are treated as victims and not as offenders.

In many cases, very little information has been offered about early childhood, with comments limited mainly to child mortality, birth registration and health care. The Committee felt the need for a discussion on the broader implications of the Convention on the Rights of the Child for young children. Accordingly, in 2004, the Committee devoted its day of general discussion to the theme “Implementing child rights in early childhood”. This resulted in a set of recommendations (see CRC/C/143, sect. VII) as well as the decision to prepare a general comment on this important topic. Through this general comment, the Committee wishes to encourage recognition that young children are holders of all rights enshrined in the Convention and that early childhood is a critical period for the realization of these rights. The Committee’s working definition of “early childhood” is all young children: at birth and throughout infancy; during the preschool years; as well as during the transition to school (see paragraph 4 below).",

    "Note 1": "The ICPD Programme of Action recognizes that realizing the right to reproductive health is a critical element of guaranteeing reproductive rights. The ICPD Programme of Action broadly defines reproductive health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.”1 Reproductive health implies that people are able to have a safe and satisfying sex life; the ability to reproduce; and the right to decide if, when, and how frequently to reproduce.2 Governments also recognized the inherent link between sustainable development, the eradication of poverty, and gender equality, and committed to address these issues in tandem. Furthermore, states agreed that coercive laws, policies, and practices that do not respect individuals’ autonomy and decision making must be eliminated. In adopting the ICPD Programme of Action, states committed to take legal, policy, budgetary, and other measures to effectuate the principles and rights enshrined in the document. Every five years since ICPD, states have come together to reaffirm this commitment, analyze the progress that has been made towards realizing sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and decide upon further actions that should be taken. At the initial five-year review of ICPD (referred to as “ICPD+5”), states agreed to utilize benchmarks and indicators to monitor the realization of sexual health and reproductive rights.3 The ICPD Programme of Action has helped shape the development and application of binding international human rights standards, including the rights protected under the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and consensus documents such as the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action, the Rio + 20 Declaration, and the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council’s resolutions on maternal mortality.4 Reducing maternal mortality and increasing access to contraceptives were also incorporated into the Millennium Development Goals, an agreed-upon set of development targets adopted in 2001 and revised in 2007. To mark 20 years since ICPD, the United Nations Population Fund is spearheading a review of countries’ progress toward the realization of the goals and rights enshrined in the ICPD Programme of Action.5 This review process incorporates a review of laws and policies that have been adopted to identify achievements and challenges, and establish further plans for action.",

Adolescent sexual intercourse contributes to worldwide burdens of unplanned pregnancy, abortion, spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, and maternal mortality and morbidity. A barrier to contraceptive care and termination of adolescent pregnancy is the belief that in law minors intellectually mature enough to give consent also require consent of, or at least prior information to, their parental guardians. Adolescents may avoid parental disclosure by forgoing desirable reproductive health care. Recent judicial decisions, however, give effect to internationally established human rights to confidentiality, for instance under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which apply without a minimum age. These judgments contribute to modern legal recognition that sufficiently mature adolescents can decide not only to request care for contraception, abortion and STIs, but also whether and when their parents should be informed.",

Minors incapable of self-determination may grant or deny assent to treatment for which guardians provide consent.

    "Meta description": "Adolescents and young people comprise almost half the world’s population. They have reproductive rights, just as adults do, but their low social status, lack of autonomy, and physical vulnerability make it more difficult for them to exercise those rights. The rights violations they encounter include a lack of comprehensive sexuality education; a lack of access to confidential health care services; child marriage; sexual violence; and female genital mutilation. Governments have a duty to empower adolescents to make informed choices and to protect themselves. Governments that impose restrictions on adolescents’ access to reproductive health information and services violate international human rights standards. Those that fail to implement laws and policies that protect adolescents from discrimination, violence, and child marriage also violate those standards. Advocating for adolescents’ reproductive rights can be challenging. Despite the critical health issues at stake, discussing the sexuality of young persons typically sparks controversy. A further challenge for advocates is confronting and refuting the assertion of culture as a justification and a defense for adolescents’ rights violations. When adolescence intersects with other factors, such as poverty, race, and gender, it compounds the challenges young women face in exercising their basic human rights.",

Historical research has linked state laws granting unmarried women early legal access to the pill (at age 17 or 18, rather than 21), to their attainment of postsecondary education and employment, increased earning power and a narrowing of the gender gap in pay, and later, more enduring marriages. Contemporary studies indicate that teen pregnancy interferes with young women’s ability to graduate from high school and to enroll in and graduate from college. Conversely, planning, delaying and spacing births appears to help women achieve their education and career goals. Delaying a birth can also reduce the gap in pay that typically exists between working mothers and their childless peers and can reduce women’s chances of needing public assistance. Unplanned births are tied to increased conflict and decreased satisfaction in relationships and with elevated odds that a relationship will fail. They are also connected with depression, anxiety and lower reported levels of happiness. Contraceptive access and consistent method use may also affect mental health outcomes by allowing couples to plan the number of children in their family. People are relatively less likely to be prepared for parenthood and develop positive parentchild relationships if they become parents as teenagers or have an unplanned birth. Close birthspacing and larger family size are also linked with parents’ decreased investment in their children. All of this, in turn, may influence children’s mental and behavioral development and educational achievement. Because not all women have shared equally in the social and economic benefits of contraception, there is more work to be done in implementing programs and policies that advance contraceptive access and help all women achieve their life goals if and when they decide to become mothers",

These comments address the issue of whether a member state of the Council of Europe (“member state”) that has by law afforded women a right to choose abortion in cases where pregnancy threatens their physical health, but failed to take effective legal and policy steps to ensure that eligible women who do so choose can exercise their right, violates its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“European Convention”). These comments argue that such failure renders the right to abortion ineffective in practice, not only depriving women of their entitlement to a reproductive health service afforded under their national law, but threatening their well-being and basic rights to, inter alia, privacy, dignity, life, health, and nondiscrimination under international law. These comments draw upon the legislation and jurisprudence of member states, the jurisprudence of this Court, and international health and human rights standards to demonstrate (1) widespread recognition of the importance of permitting and ensuring the availability and accessibility of abortion in certain circumstances, including health risks, because of the implications for women’s well-being and basic human rights, and (2) states’ obligations to ensure that women legally entitled to abortion can effectively exercise their right and access services.",

The average adolescent birth rate in middleincome countries is more than twice as high as that in high-income countries, with the rate in low-income countries being five times as high. The proportion of births that take place during adolescence is about 2% in China, 18% in Latin America and the Caribbean and more than 50% in sub-Saharan Africa.

    "Note 1": "Treaty Monitoring Body case law - CEDAW and the Human Rights Committee have also recommended that states read the health grounds in abortion regulation broadly, in accordance with the WHO definition of health, to include mental health. This includes, but is not limited to, mental health implications of carrying a pregnancy as a result of rape and mental and physical health indications in cases of severe fetal impairment. They have also explicitly asked countries that do not have explicit abortion grounds for rape, to revise laws to allow on rape grounds. (See Committee onthe Elimination of Discrimination against Women. L.C. v. Peru, CEDAW/C/50/D/22/2009, 2011; Human Rights Committee. K.L. v. Peru, Communication no. 1153/2003, UN Doc. CCPR/C/85/D/1153/2003, 2005; see also LMR v Argentina, Human Rights Committee, UN Doc. CCPR/C/101/D/1608/2007, 2011; Ipas and Center for Reproductive Rights publications listed below.)\nThe UN Human Rights Committee in the case of K.L. v Peru articulated the important intersections between fetal impairment and women’s mental and physical health when determining whether K.L., 17 years old, was entitled to a therapeutic abortion under the law. The Peruvian abortion law only permits abortion in cases when a woman’s health or life is in danger, without specifying if health includes mental health. K.L. was denied the abortion by physicians, in part, because the law did not have an explicit fetal impairment exception. The Committee, however, applied WHO’s holistic definition of health in determining that she was entitled to an abortion under the law. In doing so, the Committee recognized the ‘preventable and foreseeable’ mental distress to which she suffered when she was forced to carry the pregnancy to term. The Committee found that the denial of a lawful abortion violated her right to privacy and the right to be free from cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, as well as the right to special protection as a minor.\nIn a case before the CEDAW Committee, L.C. v Peru, Peru’s law only allows abortion when a pregnancy poses a risk to the life or health of a woman, there is no explicit rape indication.  However, the CEDAW Committee found that the 13 year-old rape victim was entitled to an abortion under the health exception for both the physical and mental health she suffered. In addition to finding violations of the Convention for failing to provide her with a lawful, therapeutic abortion, the Committee also urged the Peru to “review its legislation with a view to decriminalizing abortion when the pregnancy results from rape or sexual abuse.”\nThe abortion law before the Human Rights Committee in the case of LMR v Argentina, allowed for abortion on grounds of rape of a disabled women, but due to stigmatization of the procedure, lack of knowledge of the law, and the chilling effect of criminal sanctions, medical providers refused to perform the procedure, forcing the mentally disabled young woman to seek a clandestine abortion. The Human Rights Committee recommended that the state issue clear standards and guidelines on the legal indications for abortion and to remove barriers the inhibit women’s access to services.",

The Court found a violation of Article 3 ( right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment) and 8 (right to private life) in both cases for obstructing access to lawful reproductive health care information and services. The Court noted that it held that the Convention does not protect every act motivated or inspired by religion. ‘…States are obliged to organise the health services system in such a way as to ensure that an effective exercise of the freedom of conscience of health professionals in the professional context does not prevent patients from obtaining access to services to which they are entitled under the applicable legislation.’ RR v Poland, para 206 (2011); P and S v Poland (2012, para 106). It also notes the problems with lack of implementation and respect for the law, which includes elements allowing the right to conscientious objection to be reconciled with the patient’s interests, by making it mandatory for such refusals to be made in writing and included in the patient’s medical record and, above all, by imposing on the doctor an obligation to refer the patient to another physician competent to carry out the same service. However, it has not been shown that these procedural requirements were complied with in the present case or that the applicable laws governing the exercise of medical professions were duly respected.

    "Note 1": "The UN Human Rights Committee in the case of K.L. v Peru articulated the important intersections between fetal impairment and women’s mental and physical health when determining whether K.L., 17 years old, was entitled to a therapeutic abortion under the law. The Peruvian abortion law only permits abortion in cases when a woman’s health or life is in danger, without specifying if health includes mental health. K.L. was denied the abortion by physicians, in part, because the law did not have an explicit fetal impairment exception. The Committee, however, applied WHO’s holistic definition of health in determining that she was entitled to an abortion under the law. In doing so, the Committee recognized the ‘preventable and foreseeable’ mental distress to which she suffered when she was forced to carry the pregnancy to term. The Committee found that the denial of a lawful abortion violated her right to privacy and the right to be free from cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, as well as the right to special protection as a minor.\nIn a case before the CEDAW Committee, L.C. v Peru, Peru’s law only allows abortion when a pregnancy poses a risk to the life or health of a woman, there is no explicit rape indication.  However, the CEDAW Committee found that the 13 year-old rape victim was entitled to an abortion under the health exception for both the physical and mental health she suffered. In addition to finding violations of the Convention for failing to provide her with a lawful, therapeutic abortion, the Committee also urged the Peru to “review its legislation with a view to decriminalizing abortion when the pregnancy results from rape or sexual abuse.”\nThe abortion law before the Human Rights Committee in the case of LMR v Argentina, allowed for abortion on grounds of rape of a disabled women, but due to stigmatization of the procedure, lack of knowledge of the law, and the chilling effect of criminal sanctions, medical providers refused to perform the procedure, forcing the mentally disabled young woman to seek a clandestine abortion. The Human Rights Committee recommended that the state issue clear standards and guidelines on the legal indications for abortion and to remove barriers the inhibit women’s access to services.",

The Human Rights Committee found violations of numerous articles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, including the right to private life (Article 17).\nThe State party not only interfered in a decision concerning L.M.R.'s legally protected reproductive rights but also interfered arbitrarily in her private life, taking a decision concerning her life and reproductive health on her behalf. The Committee also noted Argentina's acknowledgement that the State's unlawful interference, through the judiciary, in an issue that should have been resolved between the patient and her physician could be considered a violation of her right to privacy.",

Health-care providers should therefore be trained to inform, counsel and treat adolescents according to their evolving capacities to understand the treatment and care options being offered, and not according to an arbitrary age cut-off. Health-care workers should support minors  to identify what is in their best interests, including consulting parents or other trusted adults about their pregnancy, without bias, discrimination or coercion.' ( chapter 3, planning and managing safe abortion care, page 68)\nevolving capacity: 'to protect the best interests and welfare of minors, and taking into consideration their evolving capacities, policies and practices should encourage, but not require, parents' engagement through support, information and education (chapter 4, legal and policy considerations, page 95 ).\nAccess to abortion; privacy 'abortion laws and services should protect the health and human rights of all women, including adolescents. They should not create situations that lead women and adolescents to seek unsafe abortion.' (chapter 3, p. 64)….access to safe abortion depends not only on the availability of services, but also on the manner in which they are delivered and the treatment of women within the clinical context. Services should be delivered in a way that respects a woman's dignity, guarantees her right to privacy and is sensitive to her needs and perspectives. Attention should be given to the special needs of the poor, adolescents, and other vulnerable and marginalized women. (chapter 3, p. 64)\nconfidentiality; privacy; autonomous decision-making: 'within the framework of national abortion laws, norms and standards should include protections for informed and voluntary decision-making, autonomy in decision-making, non-discrimination, and confidentiality and privacy for all women, including adolescents.' (chapter 3, p. 67).\nConfidentiality: 'the fear that confidentiality will not be maintained deters many women – particularly adolescents and unmarried women – from seeking safe, legal abortion services, and may drive them to clandestine, unsafe abortion providers, or to self-induce abortion. Confidentiality is a key principle of medical ethics and an aspect of the right to privacy and must be guaranteed.' (chapter 3, p. 68)\nuser fees: 'who recommends that payments from individuals for health services be collected as a type of prepayment, rather than at the time of service delivery. However, in many settings, user fees are customarily charged and can be an important barrier to services for poor women and adolescents.'(chapter 3, p. 80). Where user fees are charged for abortion, such fees should be matched to women's ability to pay, and procedures should be developed for exempting the poor and adolescents from paying for services. As far as possible, abortion services should be mandated for coverage under insurance plans. Abortion should never be denied or delayed because of a woman's inability to pay.' (chapter 3, p. 80).\nAccess to abortion: an enabling regulatory and policy environment is needed to ensure that every woman who is legally eligible has ready access to good-quality abortion services. Policies should be geared to respecting, protecting and fulfilling the human rights of women, to achieving positive health outcomes for women, to providing good-quality contraceptive and family planning information and services, and to meeting the particular needs of poor women, adolescents, rape survivors and women living with hiv.\nUnsafe abortion: it recognizes that human rights bodies require states to take action to prevent unsafe abortion, including by amending restrictive laws that threaten women's, including adolescents' lives and to provide legal abortion in cases where the continued pregnancy endangers the health of women, including adolescents (page 88)\nunsafe abortion: who recommends reducing maternal morbidity and mortality in adolescents, particularly caused by early pregnancy and unsafe abortion practices, and develop and implement programmes that provide access to sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, contraception and safe abortion services where abortion is not against the law. Make sure that all women, including adolescents have access to information about legal abortion services.\nParental consent: who recommends eliminating regulatory and policy barriers, including third-party authorization requirements that interfere with women's and adolescents' right to make decisions about reproduction and to exercise control over their bodies (p. 89). It also recognizes that excluding coverage for abortion services under health insurance, or failing to eliminate or reduce service fees for poor women and adolescents, is a barrier to safe abortion (p. 94).",

Women who have historically been marginalized based on their race, ethnicity, economic status, or age are those who face the most barriers in access to information on health, and these barriers become even greater when the information has to do with matters related to sexual and reproductive health. Access to information is closely linked to the attainment of other human rights; thus, a failure to respect and guarantee this right for women can lead to an infringement of other rights, such as their right to personal integrity, the right to privacy, rights of the family, and the right to be free from violence and discrimination.

    "Meta description": "As Latin American countries seek to guarantee sexual and reproductive health and rights, opponents of women's rights and reproductive choice have become more strident in their opposition, and are increasingly claiming conscientious objection to providing these services. Conscientious objection must be seen in the context of the rights and interests at stake, including women's health needs and right to self-determination. An analysis of law and policy on conscientious objection in Peru, Mexico and Chile shows that it is being used to erode women's rights, especially where it is construed to have no limits, as in Peru. Conscientious objection must be distinguished from politically-motivated attempts to undermine the law; otherwise, the still fragile re-democratisation processes underway in Latin America may be placed at risk. True conscientious objection requires that a balance be struck between the rights of the objector and the health rights of patients, in this case women. Health care providers are entitled to their beliefs and to have those beliefs accommodated, but it is neither viable nor ethically acceptable for conscientious objectors to exercise this right without regard for the right to health care of others, or for policy and services to be rendered ineffectual because of individual objectors. ©2009 Reproductive Health Matters.

These promises, if kept, will go a long way toward also reducing the number of abortions that take place each year in the developing world, but they cannot make the reality of abortion go away. Levels of unintended pregnancy vary across societies and over time; however, because no reversible method of birth control is perfect and few human beings use methods perfectly, women will always experience unintended pregnancies. Thus, there will always be a need for abortion, and for safe abortion services. Tragically, of the roughly 44 million abortions that take place globally each year, a rising proportion—now about half—are medically unsafe. Virtually all unsafe abortions occur in developing countries, taking a devastating toll on women’s health and lives.",

History shows social reformers experiencing religious condemnation and imprisonment for promoting means of birth control, until access became popularly accepted. Voluntary sterilization generally followed this pattern to acceptance, but overcoming resistance to voluntary abortion calls for courage and remains challenging. The challenge is aggravated by religious doctrines that view treatment of ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, and emergency contraception not by reference to women's healthcare needs, but through the lens of abortion. However, modern legal systems increasingly reject this myopic approach. Providers’ conscientious commitment is to deliver treatments directed to women's healthcare needs, giving priority to patient care over adherence to conservative religious doctrines or religious self-interest. The development of in vitro fertilization to address childlessness further illustrates the inspiration of conscientious commitment over conservative objections. © 2011 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

One year after the PoA, the Beijing Platform for Action reaffirmed paragraph 8.25 of the PoA and further called upon governments to “review laws containing punitive measures against women who have undergone illegal abortions”.3 At the PoA’s five-year review, governments recognized the need for greater safety and availability of abortion services, asserting that “in circumstances where abortion is not against the law, health systems should train and equip health-service providers and should take other measures to ensure that such abortion is safe and accessible. Additional measures should be taken to safeguard women’s health.”4 The PoA and subsequent international consensus documents have affirmed that removing legal barriers to abortion saves women’s lives, promotes their health, and empowers women to make decisions crucial to their well-being. The PoA also reflects a global trend toward abortion law liberalization—a trend that first gained momentum in the late 1960s and continues to this day. Currently, 73 countries, representing more than 60% of the world’s population, permit abortion without restriction as to reason or on broad grounds. Seventeen years after the PoA, advocates for abortion law reform can continue to point to the global commitment, declared in 1994, to stopping unsafe abortion. They can also highlight the examples of 26 countries that have removed legal restrictions on abortion in the last 17 years.",

This article describes changes in the legal status of abortion in countries around the world since 1998. METHODS: The complete texts of new abortion legislation, most often obtained directly from government web sites, were reviewed to determine changes.Background information was, where possible, also based on a review of complete legal texts. Other sources include the International Digest of Health Legislation (published by the World Health Organization) and Abortion Policies: A Global Review (published in 2002 by the Population Division of the United Nations). RESULTS: Since 1998, 16 countries have increased the number of grounds on which abortions may be legally performed; in two other countries, state jurisdictions expanded grounds for abortion. Two countries have removed grounds for legal abortion. Other countries maintained existing indications for abortion but adopted changes affecting access to the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The worldwide trend toward liberalization of abortion laws observed in 1998 has continued. Recognition of the impact of abortion restrictions on women’s human rights has played an increasing role in efforts to provide access to abortion.",

    "Meta description": "Although there are very few countries where abortion is completely illegal (and even in most of these countries the “state of necessity” can be invoked to save a woman’s life), in no country is access to abortion completely without barriers. There are always conditions placed which reflect a society’s or a government’s reluctance to allow women to access safe abortion. Such barriers are many and are incredibly complex. It is often difficult for a citizen, a health care provider or a human rights campaigner to understand (and sometimes even to find) the local, national or state abortion law(s). In addition to legal requirements – often constituting barriers to accessing safe abortion – various other barriers can reduce a woman’s ability to access a legal, safe abortion. This guide is an assessment tool that professionals and other interested people can use to become aware of legal and other obstacles that make access to safe abortion difficult or impossible. The guide also highlights the injustice that women can face. We hope that you will be inspired to act against any such injustice where it exists.",

To date, estimates of safe and unsafe abortion worldwide have only been made for 1995 and 2003. Methods We used the standard WHO definition of unsafe abortions. Safe abortion estimates were based largely on offi cial statistics and nationally representative surveys. Unsafe abortion estimates were based primarily on information from published studies, hospital records, and surveys of women. We used additional sources and systematic approaches to make corrections and projections as needed where data were misreported, incomplete, or from earlier years. We assessed trends in abortion incidence using rates developed for 1995, 2003, and 2008 with the same methodology. We used linear regression models to explore the association of the legal status of abortion with the abortion rate across subregions of the world in 2008. Findings The global abortion rate was stable between 2003 and 2008, with rates of 29 and 28 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44 years, respectively, following a period of decline from 35 abortions per 1000 women in 1995. The average annual percent change in the rate was nearly 2·4% between 1995 and 2003 and 0·3% between 2003 and 2008. Worldwide, 49% of abortions were unsafe in 2008, compared to 44% in 1995. About one in five pregnancies ended in abortion in 2008. The abortion rate was lower in subregions where more women live under liberal abortion laws (p<0·05). Interpretation The substantial decline in the abortion rate observed earlier has stalled, and the proportion of all abortions that are unsafe has increased. Restrictive abortion laws are not associated with lower abortion rates. Measures to reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion, including investments in family planning services and safe abortion care, are crucial steps toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals.

    "Meta description": "Women’s right to comprehensive reproductive health services, including abortion, is rooted in international human rights standards guaranteeing the rights to life, health, privacy, and non-discrimination. These rights are violated when governments make abortion services inaccessible to the women who need them. Under international law, governments can be held accountable for highly restrictive abortion laws and for failure to ensure access to abortion when it is legal. Governments also bear responsibility for high rates of death and injury among women forced to resort to unsafe abortion. This briefing paper takes an in-depth look at the standards developed by six United Nations (UN) “treaty monitoring bodies,” or committees, in the area of abortion. Following a brief overview of the origin and work of the committees, the briefing paper reviews standards each body has adopted as it has monitored governments’ compliance with their duties under international human rights law. The committees have been clear that governments are bound to protect women’s lives, health, and dignity by improving access to safe and legal abortion services.",

There are also societal obligations and ramifications at stake, including the responsibility for negotiating balance between all of these competing interests. Global Doctors for Choice (GDC) is a transnational network of physicians who advocate for reproductive health and rights (http://www.globaldoctorsforchoice.org). GDC became concerned about the impact of conscience-based refusal on reproductive healthcare as we began to hear increasing reports of harms from many parts of the globe. Therefore, we began to talk with colleagues and colleague organizations, to compile data, and to review policy efforts to resolve the competing interests at play. This supplement presents the result of these efforts. GDC starts from the premise that both individual conscience and autonomy in reproductive decision making are essential rights. As a physician group, we advocate for the rights of individual physicians to maintain their integrity by honoring their conscience. We simultaneously advocate that physicians maintain the integrity of the profession by according first priority to patient needs and to adherence to the highest standards of evidence-based care. We broaden the frame beyond individual physician and patient to also consider the impact of conscientious objection on other clinicians, on health systems, and on communities. When we embarked on this investigation, we found legal and ethical analyses but far fewer data regarding health. Thus, we offer a health-focused White Paper [1] as a complement to this previous work and to spur the design of a research agenda. GDC is particularly eager to bring the findings to the attention of members of FIGO, who care about physician and patient rights, about health, and about the consequences for all of the different players and interests involved. We intend this compilation and analysis of health-related information to provide the evidence base to ground our efforts as we move forward creatively together to uphold the rights and health of all.",

Likewise, other international and regional human rights treaties, as drafted and/or subsequently interpreted, clearly reject claims that human rights should attach from conception or any time before birth. They also recognise that women’s right to life and other human rights are at stake where restrictive abortion laws are in place. This paper reviews the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Inter-American Human Rights Agreements and African Charter on Human and People’s Rights in this regard. No one has the right to subordinate another in the way that unwanted pregnancy subordinates a woman by requiring her to risk her own health and life to save her own child. Thus, the long-standing insistence of women upon voluntary motherhood is a demand for minimal control over one’s destiny as a human being. From a human rights perspective, to depart from voluntary motherhood would impose upon women an extreme form of discrimination and forced labour.",

In drafting legislation or regulations regarding abortion, governments should make women’s human rights—their rights to reproductive autonomy, equality and health—the primary consideration. Governments should ensure that abortion is available at a woman’s request, without inquiry into her reasons. But even laws that permit abortion on broad grounds may undermine women’s choice by placing substantial procedural barriers in the way of abortion services. Examples of barriers to abortion include mandatory counseling and waiting periods, third-party consent requirements, short time limits, conscience clauses, limitations on funding, restrictions on medical personnel and facilities, and restrictions on abortion advertising. These procedural barriers are incompatible with governments’ duties to respect the human rights of women, and they should not appear in legislation or regulations affecting access to abortion.",

The authors’ findings suggest that the government should move to prioritize the reproductive health needs of young women and women living in the jungle regions. Moreover, they show that the prevalence of abortion in Peru is as high as or higher than the prevalence in many countries where abortion services are legally available on extended grounds and are safe. This suggests that laws limiting access to abortion services do not reduce the number of abortions, only their safety.",

    "Meta description": "Access to safe abortion care can be — and often is — a life or death issue for women. History shows that when women are determined to terminate an unintended pregnancy, if necessary, they will risk their lives to do so. Every year nearly 70,000 women die and millions more are injured because they lack access not only to safe, legal abortion services but even to humane and prompt treatment for complications of spontaneous or unsafely induced abortion (World Health Organization, 1998). These deaths and injuries represent a social injustice of tragic proportions, particularly because they are almost entirely preventable. When properly performed, abortion is one of the safest medical procedures. Similarly, prompt access to care for treatment of abortion complications virtually guarantees a good outcome. Abortion deaths contribute significantly to the greatest health disparity between rich and poor countries — deaths of women related to pregnancy. Women in wealthy industrialized countries face only a 1 in 4,100 chance of dying from pregnancy-related causes, while women in the world’s poorest countries run a lifetime risk of 1 in 16 (World Health Organization, 2001). These deaths also represent significant gender inequity in access to health services. As Dr. Mahmoud Fathalla, former president of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), has said, “Women are not dying because of diseases we cannot treat. They are dying because societies have yet to make the decision that their lives are worth saving” (Fathalla, 1997). Progress in reducing deaths and injuries of women from abortion — a clear goal of numerous international initiatives — has been woefully inadequate, hampered primarily by a lack of political will. If women's lives are to be saved, women’s right to appropriate reproductive health services, including abortion care, must be secured by ensuring that women have access to these services in their communities.",

The world’s 1.2 billion adolescents aged 10–19 account for 18% of the global population.1 While their situation differs across regions and countries, adolescents share basic rights pertaining to sexual and reproductive health, such as equality, privacy, dignity, freedom from harm and freedom to choose whether or not to marry. They also need information and services to support healthy decision making related to sexuality and reproduction. Adolescents’ needs vary depending on many factors: their stage of physical and emotional development, whether they are married, whether they have become mothers or fathers, whether they are sexually active, and what type of sexual activity and relationship they are engaged in. For example, an estimated one in four women aged 15–19 in the developing world is married or in union—that is, living with a partner.1 Marriage that takes place during adolescence is often not decided by the adolescents themselves, and young women in particular may lack power relative to older partners. Moreover, unmarried adolescents who engage in sexual activity typically face societal disapproval, which can prevent them from receiving the information and services that they need to protect their health.",

Protection of rights to act according to one's conscience, and to decline participation in activities offensive to conscientious convictions, has been recognized as a basic human right. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, formulated in 1948 by the United Nations, recognized freedom to behave in accordance with one's conscience as central to individual liberty and integrity. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, one of the key international treaties giving human rights embodied in the 1948 Declaration the force of law, states in Article 18(1) that: \"Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion...[and] to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching.\" The separate recognition of freedom of conscience and of religion is appropriate, since conscience can be based on nonreligious convictions. Religion has no monopoly on conscience but many conscientious convictions are derived from religious beliefs. This is particularly true regarding reproductive health services, where religion fuels conscientious objection to participation in abortion procedures and/or contraceptive sterilization as well as prescription or supply of emergency contraception, or even other contraceptive products. Opposition to these medical services may extend to opposition to medically assisted reproduction, for instance by variants of IVF.",

When practitioners feel obliged to place their personal conscientious interests before their patients’ interests, they have a conflict of interest. Not all conflicts can be avoided, but when they cannot, they can be resolved by due disclosure; that is, practitioners must inform potential patients of the treatments in which they object to participate on grounds of their personal conscience. Practitioners have duties to inform their patients of all medically indicated options for their care, including options in which the practitioners decline to participate. When patients select such an option, practitioners are governed by the FIGO Ethical Framework for Gynecologic and Obstetric Care (1994), paragraph 4 of which provides that: If a physician is either unable or unwilling to provide a desired medical service for non-medical reasons, he or she should make every effort to achieve appropriate referral.

In their effort to win broader public support and legitimacy, however, antiabortion leaders frequently assert that abortion is not only wrong, but that it harms women physically and psychologically. Such charges have been made repeatedly for years, but repetition and even acceptance by members of Congress and other high-ranking political officials do not make them true. Likely because the science attesting to the physical safety of the abortion procedure is so clear, abortion foes have long focused on what they allege are its negative mental health consequences. For decades, they have charged that having an abortion causes mental instability and even may lead to suicide, and despite consistent repudiations from the major professional mental health associations, they remain undeterred. For example, the “postabortion traumatic stress syndrome” that they say is widespread is not recognized by either the American Psychological Association (APA) or the American Psychiatric Association.",

Worldwide rates and patterns of mortality were investigated by WHO region, income status, and cause in age-groups of 10–14 years, 15–19 years, and 20–24 years. Findings 2·6 million deaths occurred in people aged 10–24 years in 2004. 2·56 million (97%) of these deaths were in low-income and middle-income countries, and almost two thirds (1·67 million) were in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia. Pronounced rises in mortality rates were recorded from early adolescence (10–14 years) to young adulthood (20–24 years), but reasons varied by region and sex. Maternal conditions were a leading cause of female deaths at 15%. HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis contributed to 11% of deaths. Traffic accidents were the largest cause and accounted for 14% of male and 5% of female deaths. Other prominent causes included violence (12% of male deaths) and suicide (6% of all deaths). Interpretation Present global priorities for adolescent health policy, which focus on HIV/AIDS and maternal mortality, are an important but insufficient response to prevent mortality in an age-group in which more than two in five deaths are due to intentional and unintentional injuries.",

Artificial fertility control and medically assisted reproduction are opposed by conservative religions and philosophies, whose adherents may object to participation. Physicians' conscientious objection to non-lifesaving interventions in pregnancy have long been accepted. Nurses' claims are less recognized, allowing non participation in abortions but not refusal of patient preparation and aftercare. Objections of others in health related activities, such as serving meals to abortion patients and typing abortion referral letters, have been disallowed. Pharmacists may claim refusal rights over fulfilling prescriptions for emergency (post-coital) contraceptives and drugs for medical (i.e. non-surgical) abortion. This paper addresses limits to conscientious objection to participation in reproductive health services, and conditions to which rights of objection may be subject. Individuals have human rights to freedom of religious conscience, but institutions, as artificial legal persons, may not claim this right.",

One of the more recent tactics involves significantly expanding the concept of refusal clauses (also known as exemption clauses or conscience clauses) beyond protecting the religious and moral beliefs of healthcare providers and, in effect, acting as a means to refuse some treatments and medications to all comers. Under the guise of protecting religious freedom, antichoice activists—with the backing of some members of the Catholic hierarchy—have aggressively used the political process to allow healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses and pharmacists, to opt out of providing essential reproductive healthcare services and medications. The Catholic hierarchy— through the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Catholic Health Association of the United States— has collaborated with antichoice organizations across the country both to suggest that the consciences of medical professionals are routinely violated and to expand the number of services that are considered to be subject to such an exemption. Today, many institutions struggle to formulate policies that balance the needs of patients with the beliefs of providers.",

The concept allows women to provide the children they intend to deliver with the care they consider appropriate. A negative effect occurs, however, if healthcare providers decide to treat pregnant women according to providers’ own views of the best interests of fetuses, and compromise patients’ care and self-determination without their informed consent. Some activists advocate rights of fetuses for the purpose of limiting pregnant women's self-determination. Recognition that fetuses have legitimate interests, rather than rights, is common, and opens a way to balancing various competing interests without compromising patients’ rights to decide on their medical care. Courts of law generally favor this approach, and tend to allow few limits on women's choice of indicated medical care while pregnant.",

The decision establishes objecting providers' duties to refer patients to non-objecting providers, and that hospitals, clinics, and other institutions have no rights of conscientious objection. Their professional and legal duties are to ensure that patients receive timely services. Hospitals and other administrators cannot object, because they do not participate in the procedures they are obliged to arrange. Objecting providers, and hospitals, must maintain knowledge of non-objecting providers to whom their patients must be referred. Accordingly, medical schools must adequately train, and licensing authorities approve, non-objecting providers. Where they are unavailable, midwives and perhaps nurse practitioners may be trained, equipped, and approved for appropriate service delivery. The Court's decision has widespread implications for how healthcare systems must accommodate conscientious objection and patients' legal rights. © 2008 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

    "Meta description": "In the decades since the United Nations human rights system was established, human rights bodies have increasingly addressed issues that are important for women‘s and men‘s sexual and reproductive health. Some advocates have argued that since most human rights conventions (also known as treaties, covenants and pacts) do not specify certain topics – such as sexual orientation, gender identity, reproductive choice, emergency contraception or abortion – these issues would not fall within the jurisdiction of agencies that monitor State compliance with ratified conventions. Nevertheless, the experts appointed by member nations of the UN to monitor State compliance – known variously as Treaty Monitoring Committees, Special Procedures, Special Rapporteurs, and Commissioners - received a mandate to provide guidance to States Parties on how provisions of conventions should be interpreted, so that States are clear on how human rights should be respected, promoted and fulfilled. This mandate is important because issues not specifically highlighted when conventions were drafted in the last century are now recognized as essential elements of actions needed to guarantee the rights of groups and individuals. The experts in charge of providing guidance to States Parties on fulfillment of human rights are therefore explaining how various rights – which are indivisible and interrelated – apply to areas such as the right to comprehensive sexuality education, freedom from persecution on the basis of gender identity, reduction of maternal morbidity, and mortality and elimination of unsafe abortion.",

Despite drawing sustenance from international human rights jurisprudence, their realisation at a domestic level is often precarious. In developing countries, especially, the domestic political, legal, economic, social and policy environment has often appeared particularly unwilling to yield to the imperatives of respecting sexual and reproductive health and rights in all their manifestations. In the African region, there are good reasons to take the challenge of realising rights for protecting sexual and reproductive health seriously. There is ample evidence to suggest that such rights are being denied on a significant scale. The region’s current challenges in effectively realising sexual and reproductive health for its people include: unmet needs in access to contraception; high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity, including mortality and morbidity from unsafe abortion and lack of access to obstetric care; the persistence of pandemic levels of HIV; early and/or coerced marriages; harmful cultural practices such as female genital mutilation; sexual violence and exploitation; and endemic discrimination on the basis of age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability and other vectors of discrimination. Though unmet sexual and reproductive health and rights are experienced across the gender divide, it is women who are at the receiving end of most deprivations.",

    "Meta description": "The practice of conscientious objection often arises in the area of individuals refusing to fulfil compulsory military service requirements and is based on the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion as protected by national, international and regional human rights law. The practice of conscientious objection also arises in the field of health care, when individual health care providers or institutions refuse to provide certain health services based on religious, moral or philosophical objections. The use of conscientious objection by health care providers to reproductive health care services, including abortion, contraceptive prescriptions, and prenatal tests, among other services is a growing phenomena throughout Europe. However, despite recent progress from the European Court of Human Rights on this issue (RR v. Poland, 2011), countries and international and regional bodies generally have failed to comprehensively and effectively regulate this practice, denying many women reproductive health care services they are legally entitled to receive. The Italian Ministry of Health reported that in 2008 nearly 70% of gynaecologists in Italy refuse to perform abortions on moral grounds. It found that between 2003 and 2007 the number of gynaecologists invoking conscientious objection in their refusal to perform an abortion rose from 58.7 percent to 69.2 percent. Italy is not alone in Europe, for example, the practice is prevalent in Poland, Slovakia, and is growing in the United Kingdom. This article outlines the international and regional human rights obligations and medical standards on this issue, and highlights some of the main gaps in these standards. It illustrates how European countries regulate or fail to regulate conscientious objection and how these regulations are working in practice, including examples of jurisprudence from national level courts and cases before the European Court of Human Rights. Finally, the article will provide recommendations to national governments as well as to international and regional bodies on how to regulate conscientious objection so as to both respect the practice of conscientious objection while protecting individual’s right to reproductive health care.",

Domestic and international human rights laws recognize such entitlements. Healthcare providers cannot be discriminated against, for instance in employment, on the basis of their beliefs. They are required, however, to be equally respectful of rights to conscience of patients and potential patients. They cannot invoke their human rights to violate the human rights of others. There are legal limits to conscientious objection. Laws in some jurisdictions unethically abuse religious conscience by granting excessive rights to refuse care.. In general, health care providers owe duties of care to patients that may conflict with their refusal of care on grounds of conscience. The reconciliation of patients' rights to care and providers' rights of conscientious objection is in the duty of objectors in good faith to refer their patients to reasonably accessible providers who are known not to object. Conscientious objection is unethical when healthcare practitioners treat patients only as means to their own spiritual ends. Practitioners who would place their own spiritual or other interests above their patients' healthcare interests have a conflict of interest, which is unethical if not appropriately declared.",

    "Meta description": "There are important and compelling reasons why women have second trimester abortions, which constitute a significant percentage of all abortions performed. Laws vary widely around the world on the legality of these abortions. In many cases, they are quite restrictive. Indeed, the later in pregnancy an abortion is sought, the more restrictive the law tends to be. However, many laws say little about second trimester or later abortions. This article reviews the laws of the 191 countries around the world for which information is available and categorizes them by legal indications, which include preservation of the woman's life, health reasons, pregnancy due to sex offences, fetal impairment, socio-economic reasons and on request. Given that there are serious reasons why women have second trimester abortions, and that the laws in many countries do not make these abortions legally available, this paper makes recommendations on how laws and regulations can be changed in order better to respond to women's needs. While most countries may not decriminalise all abortions in the near future, especially second trimester abortions, less comprehensive legislative and regulatory reforms are possible. These include recommendations aimed at ensuring that abortions are carried out safely and as early as possible in pregnancy, and improving access to safe abortions by removing unnecessary legal and regulatory restrictions.",

Many are reproductive health services, such as contraception, sterilization and abortion, on which women's health depends. Religious institutions that historically served a mission to provide healthcare are now perverting this commitment in order to deny care. Physicians who followed their calling honourably in a spirit of self-sacrifice are being urged to sacrifice patients' interests to promote their own, compromising their professional ethics by conflict of interest. The shield tolerant societies allowed to protect religious conscience is abused by religiously-influenced agencies that beat it into a sword to compel patients, particularly women, to comply with religious values they do not share. This is unethical unless accompanied by objectors' duty of referral to non-objecting practitioners, and governmental responsibility to ensure supply of and patients' access to such practitioners.",

The report notes that such laws and their use create barriers to access by permitting health care providers and ancillary personnel, such as receptionists and pharmacists, to refuse to provide abortion services, information about procedures, and referrals to alternative facilities and providers. He noted that these and other laws make safe abortions unavailable, especially to poor, displaced and young women and noted that such restrictive regimes serve to reinforce the stigma that abortion is an objectionable practice. He recommended that states, in order to fulfill their obligations under the right to health should “[E]nsure that conscientious objection exemptions are well-defined in scope and well-regulated in use and that referrals and alternative services are available in cases where the objection is raised by a service provider.”",

    "Meta description": "Since all countries that are members of WHO accept its constitutional description of health as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity,\" laws that allow abortion to protect women's health should be interpreted in conformity with this definition.\nEnsuring that laws, even when restrictive, are interpreted and implemented to promote and protect women's health is essential.\nSafe Abortion Guidance recognizes that the right to life and the right to health require that woman can access safe abortion when indicated to protect their life (including when a pregnancy is life threatening or otherwise) and health. Almost all countries allow abortion to be performed to save the life of the pregnant woman. This is consistent with the human right to life, which requires protection by law, including when pregnancy is life- threatening or a pregnant woman's life is otherwise endangered. Both medical and social conditions can constitute life-threatening conditions. Countries that provide detailed lists of what they consider life threatening can be misinterpreted restrictively and should not preclude clinical judgment in the situation of a particular woman. Recognizes, for example, that some doctors consider possibility of seeking life threatening clandestine abortion if woman is not provided legal abortion, could be considered falling within life exception. Even where protecting a woman's life is the only allowable reason for abortion, it is essential that there are trained providers of abortion services, that services are available and known, and that treatment for complications of unsafe abortion  is widely available. Health-care providers are obligated to provide life-saving medical care to any woman who suffers abortion-related complications, including treatment of complications from unsafe abortion, regardless of the legal grounds for abortion.\nRegarding women's health, the WHO guidance recommends interpretation of health exception in line with WHO broad definition of health. Thus, physical health is widely understood to include conditions that aggravate pregnancy and those aggravated by pregnancy. The scope of mental health includes psychological distress or mental suffering caused by, for example, coerced or forced sexual acts and diagnosis of severe fetal impairment. A woman's social circumstances are also taken into account to assess health risk.",

    "Note 2": "This guidance presents strategies for improved clinical care for women undergoing procedures, and the appropriate placement of necessary services. Medical abortion is discussed as one of the procedures and guidance is provided on regimens and health system requirements. The book’s annexes present guidance to further reading, and international consensus documents on safe abortion.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends medical methods of abortion for first trimester abortions. It has established that “medical methods of abortion have been proved to be safe and effective,” and highlights that “registration and distribution of adequate supplies of drugs for medical abortion […] are essential for improving the quality of abortion services, for any legal indication”. It recognizes that medical abortion has proven acceptable in low-resource settings since it is relatively inexpensive; in comparison to surgical abortions, it is often safer for the woman; and it can reduce costs for the health care system overall and that medical methods can be safely provided by midlevel providers.\nWHO recognizes the crucial role of misoprostol in reproductive health care and has incorporated recommendations for its use into 4 reproductive health guidelines focused on induction of labor, prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage, and management of spontaneous and induced abortion.",
    "Topics 3": "Privacy and confidentiality",
    "Note 3": "Access to safe abortion depends not only on the availability of services, but also on the manner in which they are delivered and the treatment of women within the clinical context. Services should be delivered in a way that respects a woman's dignity, guarantees her right to privacy and is sensitive to her needs and perspectives. Attention should be given to the special needs of the poor, adolescents, and other vulnerable and marginalized women. (Chapter 3, p. 64)\nWithin the framework of national abortion laws, norms and standards should include protections for informed and voluntary decision-making, autonomy in decision-making, non-discrimination, and confidentiality and privacy for all women, including adolescents.' (Chapter 3, p. 67).\nThe fear that confidentiality will not be maintained deters many women – particularly adolescents and unmarried women – from seeking safe, legal abortion services, and may drive them to clandestine, unsafe abortion providers, or to self-induce abortion. Confidentiality is a key principle of medical ethics and an aspect of the right to privacy and must be guaranteed. Health-care providers therefore have a duty to protect medical information against unauthorized disclosures, and to ensure that women who do authorize release of their confidential information to others do so freely and on the basis of clear information. Adolescents deemed mature enough to receive counselling without the presence of a parent or other person are entitled to privacy, and may request confidential services and treatment (see Section 3.3.5.4).\nHealth-service managers should ensure that facilities provide privacy for conversations between women and providers, as well as for actual services. For example, procedure rooms should be partitioned for visual and auditory privacy, and only facility staff required for the induced abortion should be present. There should be a private place for undressing, curtained windows, and cloth or paper drapes to cover the woman during the procedure.",

    "Note 5": "Recognizes that mid-level health workers can be trained to provide safe abortion services, increasing availability and accessibility without compromising safety, especially where doctors are few and not readily accessible to women. Recognizes that restrictions on the range of providers (e.g. gynecologists only) or facilities (e.g. tertiary level only) that are legally authorized to provide abortion reduce the availability of services, and their equitable geographic distribution, requiring women to travel greater distances for care, thereby raising costs and delaying access.\n\nThe regulation of facilities and providers should be evidence-based to protect against over- medicalized, arbitrary or otherwise unreasonable requirements. Facility and provider regulation should be based on criteria currently required for provision of safe abortion care (see Chapter 3). Vacuum aspiration and the medical methods recommended in Chapter 2 can be safely provided at primary health-care level by midlevel providers.",
    "Topics 6": "Conscientious objection",
    "Note 6": "Who recommends the Establishment of national standards and guide- lines facilitating access to and provision of safe abortion care to the full extent of the law. It recommends that such standards and guidelines should cover conscientious objection (p.63).\nWHO recognizes conscientious objection as a barrier to lawful abortion services which impedes women from reaching the services for which they are eligible and contribute to unsafe abortion (p.87). In such cases, health-care providers must refer the woman to a willing and trained provider in the same, or another easily accessible health-care facility, in accordance with national law. Where referral is not possible, the health-care professional who objects, must provide safe abortion to save the woman’s life and to prevent damage to her health. WHO further recommends that health services should be organized in such a way as to ensure that an effective exercise of the freedom of conscience of health professionals does not prevent patients from obtaining access to services to which they are entitled under the applicable legislation. Laws and regulations should not entitle providers and institutions to impede women’s access to lawful health services (pp. 69, 94, 96).\nThe WHO has further pointed out that health providers owe their patients an ethical obligation, which requires them to inform patients of all the treatment options available. WHO also recommends that the training content for abortion service providers includes ethical responsibility to provide abortion (or to refer women when the health-care professional has conscientious objection to providing abortion) and to treat complications from unsafe abortion (p. 73).",

These and other factors will influence her decision to either carry a pregnancy to term or seek an abortion. Given the complexity of this decision, the only person equipped to make it is the pregnant woman herself. Governments should respect a woman’s human right to make decisions regarding her reproductive life. A woman who decides to have an abortion—as 46 million women do annually2 —must have access to the facilities and care that will enable her to terminate her pregnancy safely. Governments that prosecute and punish women who have had abortions penalize women for exercising their basic rights. These rights are no less compromised when a woman who decides to terminate a pregnancy can do so only by under taking a serious risk to her life and health. International legal support for a woman’s right to safe and legal abortion can be found in numerous international treaties and other instruments, and the relevant provisions of these documents are listed in Table I. The right to choose abortion has support in guarantees of life and health, freedom from discrimination, and autonomy in reproductive decision-making.",

Legal abortion to preserve a women's mental health is explicitly recognized in the laws of 23 countries. However, the law is implemented in different countries in varied ways, giving rise to a range of access to safe abortion among countries with similar laws. In this paper, 1 propose the enactment of guidelines for implementing the mental health indication to improve access to safe abortion. Such guidelines should enable providers to consider a woman's social and economic circumstances in determining the risk of pregnancy to her mental health. This approach is supported by global health authorities and psychological research. I also present empirical and legal support for the notion that abortion can lead to favorable mental health outcomes, as is implicit in the mental health indication.",

    "Meta description": "To reduce the health toll of abortion complications—and decrease the incidence of abortion—it is vital to help women avoid unwanted pregnancies. Designing interventions to accomplish this requires information that sheds light on the subgroups of women most likely to have an unintended pregnancy, which is generally available only in countries in which abortion is legal or not highly restricted. The type of information available in the data collection systems of these countries varies, but age is the most commonly recorded characteristic. Using data from more than 40 countries where legal abortion is generally available, Gilda Sedgh and colleagues calculated age-specific abortion rates and percentage distributions of abortions by age, taking into account the estimated completeness of reporting [page 143]. Drawing on information on contraceptive use and unmet need in the countries studied, the authors speculate that higher abortion rates in particular age-groups probably reflect higher than average levels of unmet need for contraception or difficulty in using methods effectively, as well as a stronger desire to avoid childbearing. Since the advent of medication abortion in the late 1980s, increasingly more women in settings where abortion is illegal or highly restricted have, for the first time, had access to a safe, effective and discreet means of pregnancy termination. Although use of mifepristone, followed by a prostaglandin (usually misoprostol), is the regimen with the highest efficacy and the fewest side effects, misoprostol is often used alone when mifepristone is not available. Because it is inexpensive and stable at room temperature, it is ideal for use in low-resource settings. Noting that medication abortion is now an indispensable part of abortion care in developed countries, authors Beverly Winikoff and Wendy Sheldon call for equitable access for women in developing countries [page 164].",

It was estimated that in 2003 approximately 42 million10 pregnancies were voluntarily terminated: 22 million safely and 20 million unsafely. Unsafe abortions are frequently performed by providers lacking qualifications and skills to perform induced abortion, and some abortions are self-induced. Unsafe induced abortions do not meet officially prescribed circumstances and safeguards; they are aggravated by unhygienic conditions, dangerous interventions or incorrect administration of medication. Although unsafe abortions are preventable, they continue to pose undue risks to a woman’s health and may endanger her life. WHO defines unsafe abortion as a procedure for terminating an unintended pregnancy carried out either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both.11 While the definition seems to be linked to the process, characteristics of an unsafe abortion touch on inappropriate circumstances before, during or after an abortion.",

In light of the interdependence of woman and fetus, as well as the broader social context shaping these decisions, I argue that a more contextual, relational perspective of autonomy should be the goal of informed consent in the context of reproductive choices.

In many countries, debate on conscientious objection focuses to a great extent on national legal frameworks, as well as medical ethics. This publication is designed to demonstrate the bearing of international human rights law on conscientious objection. It gives examples of how the issue has already been addressed in the context of international law and provides information and makes recommendations on the relationship between conscientious objection and sexual and reproductive health rights, as well as States’ obligations to uphold these rights.",

The provision of information to young people needs to be improved and expanded using a variety of methods—including providing family life education to young people in schools and reaching those who are not attending school.",

    "Note 1": "The UN Human Rights Committee in the case of K.L. v Peru articulated the important intersections between fetal impairment and women’s mental and physical health when determining whether K.L., 17 years old, was entitled to a therapeutic abortion under the law. The Peruvian abortion law only permits abortion in cases when a woman’s health or life is in danger, without specifying if health includes mental health. K.L. was denied the abortion by physicians, in part, because the law did not have an explicit fetal impairment exception. The Committee, however, applied WHO’s holistic definition of health in determining that she was entitled to an abortion under the law. In doing so, the Committee recognized the ‘preventable and foreseeable’ mental distress to which she suffered when she was forced to carry the pregnancy to term. The Committee found that the denial of a lawful abortion violated her right to privacy and the right to be free from cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, as well as the right to special protection as a minor.\nIn a case before the CEDAW Committee, L.C. v Peru, Peru’s law only allows abortion when a pregnancy poses a risk to the life or health of a woman, there is no explicit rape indication.  However, the CEDAW Committee found that the 13 year-old rape victim was entitled to an abortion under the health exception for both the physical and mental health she suffered. In addition to finding violations of the Convention for failing to provide her with a lawful, therapeutic abortion, the Committee also urged the Peru to “review its legislation with a view to decriminalizing abortion when the pregnancy results from rape or sexual abuse.”\nThe abortion law before the Human Rights Committee in the case of LMR v Argentina, allowed for abortion on grounds of rape of a disabled women, but due to stigmatization of the procedure, lack of knowledge of the law, and the chilling effect of criminal sanctions, medical providers refused to perform the procedure, forcing the mentally disabled young woman to seek a clandestine abortion. The Human Rights Committee recommended that the state issue clear standards and guidelines on the legal indications for abortion and to remove barriers the inhibit women’s access to services.",

    "Meta description": "Over the last twenty years the international community-realizing that the tragedy of women dying during pregnancy and in childbirth could no longer be tolerated-launched a series of initiatives aimed at making safe motherhood a cornerstone of health services in all countries. Making pregnancy and delivery safe events is particularly complex, as it involves infrastructural and logistic, as well as technical, issues. Women die because they have no access to skilled personnel during pregnancy and at the time of delivery and because--if an emergency situation arises--they cannot reach a facility where emergency obstetric services are available. FIGO, the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology-as the only global organization representing the Obstetricians of the world-decided some time ago that it could not limit its activities to proposing technical guidelines and debating scientific issues. It had to move into the field and, through its affiliated societies, help change the ability of the multitude of women in the developing world to obtain skilled attendance at birth. In 1997, plans were made to launch activities in five areas where maternal mortality was particularly high: Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador), Ethiopia, Mozambique, Pakistan, and Uganda. Five member societies from the developed world (the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, the Italian Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of the United Kingdom; and the Swedish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology) agreed to provide support to their counterparts in these five selected areas. The project is now in its final stage. Results are, by and large, positive, demonstrating that, by motivating health professionals in the field and for a relatively modest financial outlay, more efficient use of existing services could be made in a sustainable fashion to save lives.",
