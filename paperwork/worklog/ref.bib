              retrieval system used to support the defense of a large corporate
              lawsuit. The following year Salton published an article which
              called into question the conclusions of the 1985 study. The
              following article briefly reviews the initial study, replies to
              the objections raised by the second article, and clarifies
              several confusions and misunderstandings about the 1985 study.",
